# Compiler vs Interpreter

- The main aim of theses two are
1. To check errors
2. Convert into machine code
3. Execution / running a program : Compiler does not takes
responsibility of execution , Interpreter is responsible for execution of
code

## Compiler
• C++ is a compiler based language
• Compiler will convert program into machine code if they are no error
• Compilation from source code to machine code is done only once
• As translation is done once that is why compiler doesn't run codes
• Even if there’s one error in the program , it will not compile the full code
must be error free to transform into machine code.

## Interpreter
• JavaScript is an interpreter based language
• JS runs inside browser , it cannot run independently
• It translate and runs /executes the code line by line
• Translation is done again and again

## Compiler vs Interpreter
• Compiler is faster than interpreter
• In interpreter if there is error in one line the code will still execute
• Interpreter language is easy than compiler language
